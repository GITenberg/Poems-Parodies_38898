<div class="vspace" style="height: 2em">
</div>
<p class="pfirst"><span>Two simple words, charged now for some of
us with sad and infinite memories.  It is not the
death of the Professor, nor of the soldier, nor of
the politician--nor even of the poet or the
essayist--that causes the heart-ache that we feel.  It
is the loss of that rare, charming, wondrous
personality summed up in those two simple words,
TOM KETTLE.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>A genial cynic, a pleasant pessimist, an earnest
trifler, he was made up of contradictions.  A
fellow of infinite jest--and infinite sadness.  His
prototypes were Hamlet or the Melancholy
Jacques.  Among the delightful essays he has
left us in that charming little book, </span><em class="italics">The Day's
Burden</em><span>, is one entitled "A new way of
misunderstanding </span><em class="italics">Hamlet</em><span>."  He was himself a veritable
Hamlet in this twentieth century Ireland.  One
may ask, did he quite understand himself?  Master
of paradox, enunciator of enigma, he was a paradox
and an enigma in, and to, himself.  Shall we seek
now to pluck out the heart of his mystery?  The
lines are hackneyed beyond hope, but in this
instance they apply in truth.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The personality of Kettle had in it something
subtle; something essential yet elusive;
something not to be defined.  He was a great talker
in the Johnsonian sense.  As a story-teller, it
was not so much the point of his tale that counted
as his telling of it.  The divagations from the text
in which he loved to indulge were the delight of
his auditors.  With truth it may be said that his
rich humour, his brilliant, mordant wit, caused
his listeners to hang upon his words.  And his
outlook was so wide, his soul so big, his mind so
broad, and a deep love of humanity so permeated
him that his talk, or one might more fittingly
say, his discourse, was educating and uplifting.
But he was a man of moods, descending from
heights of Homeric humour to the depths of a
divine despair.  Those privileged to hear him
thus expounding will cherish the memory while
they live.  We, too, as it were, have "seen
Shelley plain."  He charmed, he fascinated.  This,
in truth, describes him for his spell wrought even
on those who actually disliked him.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>In the numerous notices printed of him since
he died much has been written of the promise of
his career.  More appropriate it would be to
write of his performance.  He crowded into
thirty-six years of life far more than most men
achieve in twice that span.  Now the orator is
silent, the brilliant wit has ceased to sparkle,
the skilful pen will ply no more.  Tom Kettle
knows at last the answer to the riddle that baffled
him, the Riddle of the Universe.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Well may we mourn--</span></p>

<p class="pfirst"><span>Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™'s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will remain
freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future generations. To

<h4 class="level-4 pfirst section-title title"><span>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation</span></h4>
<p class="pfirst"><span>Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing
the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely
distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest array of
equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to
$5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status
with the IRS.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit </span><a class="reference external" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate">http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate</a></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

<p class="pfirst"><span>Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg™
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone. For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the
U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Corrected </span><em class="italics">editions</em><span> of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number. The replaced older file is
renamed. </span><em class="italics">Versions</em><span> based on separate sources are treated as new
eBooks receiving new filenames and etext numbers.</span></p>
